## üç≥ About the Project

The project is a web application focused on helping users discover new recipes in an intuitive and efficient way. The website's unique feature is having a page where users can discover recipes based on the ingredients they have in their kitchen, helping them explore new flavors with ingredients they already have at their disposal.

The application offers a fluid user experience, allowing users to search for different types of recipes and view each one in detail, including ingredients, preparation instructions and preparation time, nationality...

## üí° Learnings

Through the development of the Recipe Project, I learned and delved into:

- **CSS modules** -> Use a CSS file for global settings and scope the rest with modules for each React component
- **Responsiveness** -> I learned new measures to make the layout flexible with less code ( container-type, cqh, cqw )
- **Tests** -> I implemented some tests to improve the reliability of the project with vitest and react testing library
- **React Router** ->
    - I learned about managing a website's routes, error page, routes with variable values. - I learned about the 3 rendering patterns of a website (SPA, SSR and SSG)
    - Reuse data between pages through useNavigate
    - Get URL parameters through useLocation
- **Hooks** -> Control state through useState, side effects through useState, avoid prop drilling through useContext, manipulate DOM through useRef
- **Lifecycle** -> When the component re-renders (When its state changes, when its props change, when the parent component updates...)
- **Conditional rendering**
